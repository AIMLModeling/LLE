# LLE
Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) is a method of Non Linear Dimensionality reduction which performs nonlinear dimensionality reduction by preserving the neighborhood structure of the data points.  I explained the logic of regular and several variants of LLE, then demonstrated how to implement them in Python.  https://youtu.be/ewnQn8kxJEA
